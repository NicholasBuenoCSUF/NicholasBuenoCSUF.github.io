* Lab 6, Part 2

  This lab reintroduced me to blackjack and in a way, taught me all of the outcomes and possibilities of each hand in blackjack. It mainly served as a good check of understanding of understanding how your code will run before running it as tracking each possible outcome on each turn before continuing was a good exercise to understand each test case. While a bit time consuming, it serves as a good check for understanding before running into further problems later down the line in code.

* Lab 4, Part 1

  Using recursion multiple times in an instance such as converting units was the main test of this lab and contributed to my overall understanding of recursion. Instead of getting lost forgetting what each function does to the inputted values, this lab showed me that it's important to keep track of what's being done to each value after each line of code has been run. Understanding why a value has changed and not letting it get lost in another mix while coding was a key takeaway I got from this lab.

* Lab 11, Part 1

  While I come from using arrays, this lab made the understanding and complexity of using vectors a lot lighter and easier. Compiling large amounts of data and values with vectors seemed daunting at first, but with this lab, it took away a lot of that fear and led me to understand loops with large amounts of data better. While it can be scary to possibly run into issues while coding, this helped alleviate it.
